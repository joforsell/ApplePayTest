#  Apple Pay Test

![Short showcase of the project](ApplePayTestExample.gif)


## What is it?

Apple Pay Test is a very simple demo project made to show an example Apple Pay flow.


## Why did I make it?

I made it both to learn how to implement Apple Pay and to show potential future clients/employers that I can.


## How to successfully run the project on your machine

To use Apple Pay you need an active [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).
There's some setup required before you start, Apple provide a guide [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/apple_pay/setting_up_apple_pay).
Make sure to update the Bundle ID from _com.joforsell_ to match your own organization identifier.


## Credits

I used [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/apple_pay/offering_apple_pay_in_your_app) to help set up the Apple Pay functionality.
I also watched [Design+Code's two part series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwG1pDgytDc) to get an idea of how to bridge it with SwiftUI.
